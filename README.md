This example demonstrates a common error when using the `$expr` operator with `$toDouble` in MongoDB.  The `$toDouble` operator is crucial for type conversion when using comparison operators with fields that might contain numeric strings, but it's important to handle cases where the field is missing or contains non-numeric data.  The provided solution shows how to incorporate error handling to prevent unexpected query failures.
